<!-- Root element.
Every XML MUST contain a root element that is parent of all elements
<friendsList> is the root!

XML Prolog: is optional and is the first line
Starts and ends with ?
In our XML, we can also use international characters so it's good practice to provide the encoding being used

On XML prologs, note that you'll receive a "processing instruction target matching is not allowed" issue
if the XML prolog is not at the VERY top of your documents. Even if comments are above the XML prolog, the error will fire.

Default encoding format is UTF-8
All XML elements must have a closing tag

XML tags are case sensitive

<!-- XML is used to store and transport data between two apps in a manner that's
platform and tech stack agnostic. XML stands for extensible markup language
and is written using tags <> or marks.
XML does not use predefined tags like HTML and can be extended.
XML is also both human and machine readable (like JSON) and a W3C recommendation
W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)

XML validation
Validation all the syntax and structure of our XML messages
    Does it satisfy all the basic syntax conditions?
    Does it behave according to a predefined DTD (Document type definition) or XSD (XML Schema Definition?)
        In most cases, the creator of these schemas will provide them to you and you'll have to check your XML against it
        Schema will contain various info such as what's mandatory or not, what data type should be inside the text, XML structure / how to structure it, what should be the text, etc.

XML Schemas (cont'd)
    Grammar and content check is done here
    Most of the cases today XSD is used, in case you don't have a xst or dtd or any schema - you can take your own XML and
    generate a schema out of it

Look online for an XML schema generator or an XML to XSD converter / XML to DTD converter
Converted XSD shows your element names and shows the elements that have other elements inside them as complex types
It even shows the name as of type string!

XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human readable and machine readable
